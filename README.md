# 3D-Printer-Tools-Accessories
Here is a list of all the 3D printer tools and accessories I have ever bought for my 3d printer.
This collection features all the 3D printing tools and accessories I use in my setup. To better organize and share them, I created a GitHub repository where I’ve listed everything I use. Each item includes links to the original sources, along with relevant information and helpful tips.

Please note: I am not affiliated with any of these products, and this collection is not sponsored. All recommendations are based solely on my personal experience. Additionally, I take no responsibility for any damage or issues these tools might cause to your printer.

Almost all of these were printed in PLA

I use OrcaSlicer, and you can adjust this setting in the `Quality` tab under the `Precision` section. Look for the line item labeled `X-Y Hole Compensation.` I typically tweak this setting whenever I switch filament types (e.g., PLA to PETG) or before starting a large print. While there are other methods to achieve similar results, I’ve found this approach to work quite well for me

### BIQU Panda Lux Light Strip for BambuLab A1 Printer
Product Link:
```bash

```
I’d rate this product nearly a 10/10. Overall, it does exactly what it promises: it’s a light strip with a light sensor that attaches to your printer’s existing light, giving you control over it. However, the adhesive isn’t great and took a few minutes to stick properly. Be patient, and it should eventually hold. If it doesn’t, you can try reinforcing it with super glue or even hot glue. Your results may vary, but once it stays in place, it works as expected.

### Deburring Tool

Its a deburring tool - its great. ~~I will leave a link to a file for storring it once ive printed one. But right now I have not done that.~~ Got around to printing the tool case for it and i love it. Best one so far! I used the screws from HomeDepot and just got some socket ones, same length as in the site. 

### 500g x 2 Packs Rechargeable Desiccant

I keep my printer in the garage, and during the summer, it can get quite humid. My printer is inside the canvas case I’ve linked here, which provides some protection. To help mitigate the humidity, I purchased these items. While they should help, a proper dehumidifier chamber for both filament and the printing environment would be the ideal solution. For now, this setup works for me. Additionally, I have a window AC unit in the garage, which also helps manage the humidity.

### Enclosure Tent
```bash

```
I originally used this for my Ender 3 Pro V3 KE, but I no longer have that printer. It also fits my Bambu Labs A1 printer perfectly. I have my printer placed on a 12x12 paver inside the tent, which I’ve found helps with both vibrations and stability. The paver adds mass to the setup, which dampens vibrations caused by the printer’s moving parts and provides a stable, level surface. This can also help reduce noise and improve print quality. Picked the paver up at Home depot.
